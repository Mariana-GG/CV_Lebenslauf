### ðŸŒ¸ Cultivating Code, Connecting People

Hello! My journey into software development began not with a line of code, but with a question: how can technology feel more human? With a background in psychology, I don't just build applications; I build environments. I believe the most resilient, sustainable, and beautiful systems are rooted in empathy, clarity, and a deep respect for the people who use them and build them.

My approach is simple: create organized, elegant code while nurturing a team culture where everyone feels safe enough to be vulnerable, motivated enough to be brilliant, and supported enough to grow.

### What I Bring to the Garden ðŸŒ·

*   **Architecting with Empathy:** My strength lies in seeing the entire ecosystemâ€”from the high-level system architecture down to the intricate dynamics of a team. I design roadmaps that are not just technically sound, but also human-centric and sustainable.

*   **Leading with Clarity:** I thrive on turning ambiguity into actionable plans. This means creating clear documentation, establishing gentle but firm processes, and ensuring every voice is heard, transforming chaos into beautiful, collaborative order.

*   **Fostering Resilient Teams:** I champion a "culture of celebrating failures." A bug isn't a crisis; it's a shared learning opportunity. I am dedicated to creating spaces where psychological safety allows for creativity, honest feedback, and mutual growth.

### My Foundational Project: Bitamin ðŸŒº

This project was a 3-week sprint that tested every limit and ultimately solidified my passion. We built an API-driven app to challenge calorie-counting culture, and I had the honor of leading our team through the beautiful storm.

*   **Vision & Leadership:** I guided our 4-person team from a chaotic start to a clear proof-of-concept, defining the system architecture and product roadmap.
*   **Process & Growth:** I independently built our CI/CD pipeline and Git workflow (structuring 65 issues, conducting 12 code reviews), turning our motto "If you can cook, you can code" into a reality.
*   **Resilience & Contribution:** I wrote 163 of our 364 commits, leading debugging sessions that built deep team resilience and proved that vulnerability is a superpower in development.

P.S. When I'm not untangling code, you can probably find me debating the delicious merits of the perfect taco versus the perfect Bretzel. Itâ€™s a wonderful dilemma. ðŸŒ®ðŸ¥¨
